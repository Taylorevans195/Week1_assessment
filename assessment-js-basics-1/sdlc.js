// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Implementation
// Design
// Maintain
// Analysis of Requirements
// Testing & Integration
// Planning


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
    
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const Implementation =" This is the phase in which the actual software is built"
const Design = "In this phase the 'blueprint' of the project is fully defined "
const Maintain ="This is the part where the program is monitored to make sure that everything is running smoothly"
const AnalysisOfRequirements ="This phase is were the software stystem is indentified and documented to deside what the software needs to do"
const testingandIntegration = "the testing phase is imortant to get right because its were the develpoer will need to make sure the the software checks all the boxs before beings put out into the public"
const Planning = "this step lays the whole foundation for the project"
